# Wakanda and Foundation

Wakanda uses its own framework, WAF, to build widgets and layouts. They are great and make rapid development easy. The only problem is they aren't very responsive.

There is a good set of APIs available to any JavaScript, regardless of if it comes from WAF or a different framework. In an attempt to build a responsive app with Wakanda, I am trying out Foundation.
